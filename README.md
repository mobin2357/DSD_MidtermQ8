# DSD_MidtermQ8
in this repository, I present a verilog model for the problem 8 of the midterm exam.
the final report is a pdf file in the Document folder.
in the Code folder, there are 3 main files that contain the codes: Q8.v is the code for the top module in part a and Q8TB.v is as test bench  for part a. synthesizable_Q8.v is essentially the same as Q8.v but it is synthesizable for the part b of the problem.
